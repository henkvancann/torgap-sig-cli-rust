# Blockchain Commons torgap-sig-cli-rust

`torgap-sig-cli-rust` is a fork of [rsign2](https://github.com/jedisct1/rsign2), a Rust implementation of [Minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/), with support for
Tor onion v3 hidden service keys.

## Why is torgap-sig-cli-rust relevant?

Torgap-sig-cli builds on the fact that Minisig appears to be a universal donor for ed25519 signatures, usable anywhere, by a variety of different programs. This includes Tor, which uses ed25519 keys for its hidden services. Using Tor with Minisig allows for the issuance of digital signatures that enable the Tor owner to prove control, without requiring any external authorities.

This has allowed for the experimental creation of `did:onion` DIDs, whoch can be used to enable verifiable decentralized digital identities and associated verifiable claims (VCs).

### Why Tor?

Tor is private and decentralized by design: no centralized registries or identity providers are required to access or offer onion services.

When used with DIDs, Tor can provide two strong advantages not available in most other DID methods: censorship-resistance and non-correlation.

The *censorship-resistance* means that it's difficult to block the lookup or usage of Tor-enabled DID.

The *non-correlation* means that: the controller of a DID can be pseudonymous; the signer of a claim can be pseudonymous; and, perhaps most importantly, an end-user investigating a claim or a DID is not correlatable. In other words, the non-correlation of Tor is bidirectional.

A use case would be for a user to look up the signature of a software package without revealing to the signer that they are interested in the package.

### What is Torgap?

Torgap is an architectural feature created by Blockchain Commons that allows for apps and microservices to be separated by a Tor connection, creating advantages of anonymity and privacy. It can also created additional advantages of stability and availability in distributed quorum computing situations.

The `did:onion` DID experiment is an example of such a Torgap, creating DID and VC microservices across the gap.

See the [torgap repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap) for more info.

## Status - Experimental

`torgap-sig-cli-rust` is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

### Ongoing Progress

Details of this experiment are still being discussed with people in the W3C DID community. We are for a lean and mean approach.

It is unlikely we’ll support `DIDcomm` as is, more likely choosing something closer to the protocol used by Signal. We might favor the inclusion of some fundamental elements like the [perfect forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) that Signal does.

 The torgap-sig-cli-rust experiment is aimed at the trustless & censorship resistant side of the digital identity spectrum. It is envisioned as a DID that is anti-correlation and  works with `Lightning Network`. It is not intended for personal or legal identity.

## Installation Instructions

Install with:

`cargo build`

The resulting executable is `target/debug/rsign`

You can alternatively run and build automatically with a single command: `cargo run`.

For more information: `cargo run help`

Note that `cargo run help` is equivalent to `target/debug/rsign help` and when using `cargo run`, `cargo build` can be omitted, as it's already automatically executed.

## Usage Instructions

`torgap-sig-cli-rust` allows a file to be signed and its signature to be verified with an onion v3 address.

Any file can be used:

```sh
echo "Mr. Watson--come here--I want to see you." > myfile.txt
```

Sign the file with the `rsign` command:

```sh
rsign sign myfile.txt
Password: 
**********
Deriving a key from the password and decrypting the secret key... done
```

A detached signature is generated:

```sh
untrusted comment: signature from rsign secret key
RWTFh+S84tByDXDoISKOL7c1WOCON2DbmQjFuRbJH1XTcr/79yX2gHw8L3YvMoxQU+RjbWrQz5UjVCrKGWu/AlWx1AH0xskHSQc=
trusted comment: timestamp:1605303858 file:myfile.txt addr:fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion
pp15vK04ItsRBNooW9K/BAxyCVZyrp4vxiJ7draB2bKyzm3w3ChWwnLFAuzKPHqG0ZL6Am39Xde9aFQ+rebzBA==
```

`rsign` can then be used to verify this signature with an onion address:

```sh
rsign verify myfile.txt --onion-address fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion
Signature and comment signature verified
Trusted comment: timestamp:1605303858 file:myfile.txt addr:fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion
```

Minisign keys can be generated using `rsign generate` and exported to Tor hidden service keys via `rsign export-to-onion-keys`, i.e. `hs_ed25519_secret_key`, `hs_ed25519_public_key`, `hostname`. 
The reason you import signing-capable keys in `Tor` hidden service, is because you can’t go in the other direction and use exported Tor private keys, outside of Tor. Tor keys simply cannot be converted back to minisign key format. In fact Tor private keys can't used anywhere else, expect within Tor.


For more information on setting this up, see the [Manual](docs/MANUAL.md).
